Brass Ingot,
Glowing Ingot,
Multiple Ingot,

Osmium Ingot,
Uranium Ingot,

Generally all the above will have their own Ingot, Block, Gear, Dust, Nugget, Plate.

Raw Ores Which Should Be ReTextures
```

Zinc,
Silver,

We can always add custom texturing to all the different ore types should we feel the need to but it is not required
I just highlighted some of the main ones that I felt would be a good choice.
