## A Consistent Styling Towards Ingots, Raw Types, Gears, Dusts, etc.


Ingot Types (Block Variants are not Completed)
```
Iron Ingot, -> Done
Gold Ingot, -> Done
Copper Ingot, -> Done
Zinc Ingot, -> Done
Brass Ingot, -> Done
```
Generally all the above will have their own Ingot, Block, Gear, Dust, Nugget, Plate.

Raw Ores Which Should Be ReTextures
```
Copper, -> Done
Gold,-> Done
Zinc, -> Done
Silver, -> Done
Lead, -> Done
Tin, -> Dome
Uranium, -> Done
Aluminum,
Osmium,-> Done
Nickel
```

Plates
```
Iron, -> Done
Steel,-> Done
Lead,-> Done
Bronze,
Aluminum,
Gold, -> Done
Copper, -> Done
Tin,-> Done
Silver,-> Done
Nickel,
Electrum,-> Done
Invar,
Zinc -> Done
```

Gears
```
Iron,-> Done
Copper, -> Done
Tin,-> Done
Steel, -> Done
Bronze,
Gold, -> Done
Lead,-> Done
Silver,-> Done
Nickel,
Electrum,-> Done
Invar,
Zinc -> Done
```

Rods
```

Lead,-> Done
Silver, -> Done,
Tin, -> Done

```


We can always add custom texturing to all the different ore types should we feel the need to but it is not required
I just highlighted some of the main ones that I felt would be a good choice.
